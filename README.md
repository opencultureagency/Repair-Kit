  (1 kit at a time or multiple kits in parallel)
- printing and cutting the photos of the tools

## Footsteps

This "Repair Kit" originated from the universal modules idea of the [#ASKotec](https://askotec.openculture.agency) the source files of other training modules and kits can be found via [ASKotec-Modules](https://github.com/opencultureagency/ASKotec-Modules). The design is inspired and in parts integrated from there.
